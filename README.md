# 🔐 Security Audit Portfolio

This repo serves as a central place to store and showcase security audits of smart contracts I've reviewed, including vulnerability findings, secure coding best practices, and remediation recommendations. Whether for bug bounties, freelance projects, or independent research, this portfolio is built to reflect my hands-on expertise in blockchain security.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- 📚 Build a public archive of all smart contract audits I’ve completed
- 🛠️ Demonstrate technical skills in smart contract security analysis
- 🔍 Show practical findings across real-world and simulated projects
- 🚀 Support my personal and professional growth in the Web3 security space

---

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here

As this portfolio grows, I’ll be adding:

- Structured audit reports written in Markdown
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code when applicable
- Code snippets from audited smart contracts
- Risk ratings and severity classifications
- Recommended fixes and mitigation strategies
- Optional automated tool outputs (e.g., Slither, Foundry, Mythril)

---

## 🛠 Tooling & Methodology

I combine both manual and automated approaches to auditing:

- **Static Analysis**: Slither, Mythril, Surya
- **Fuzzing & Testing**: Foundry (`forge test`, `forge fuzz`)
- **Manual Review**: Line-by-line vulnerability inspection
- **Utilities**: Hardhat, Ethers.js, cast, web3.js
